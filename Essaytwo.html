        <h1>The Original Design</h1>
        
        <p class="prayer">Prayer: Lord, open our eyes so we may see what is missing. We lay aside our pride and arrogance so we could eat from the scrolls to understand what You have for us as our creator. <cite>- In Jesus name, Amen.</cite></p>

        <p><span>John 20</span> gives us an account of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is important to understand the resurrection as Christians because, without the resurrection, there is no accurate proof that the work that our Father has done through His Son is finished. The resurrection is the physical manifestation that Jesus has authority over life and death. </p>

        <p>The actions of Mary Magdalene struck my attention the most. The Bible says that Mary went to the tomb very early on the first day of the week to check on Jesus. The question is why Mary,  of all the disciples around, was the one to go to the tomb to check on Jesus. Was it because of her nurturing nature as a woman? Her deep respect, reverence, and devotion to her savior? It could be both or it had nothing to do with her. Why was she the first to see the risen Jesus? If anything, being the first meant something. I mean, the reason why the first child in the family is not just a symbol of love, but also trust. I mean Jesus could have waited till the other disciples were stirred enough in their spirit to visit the tomb but He didn’t. Mary waking up early was a personal conscription pulled by a deep devotion to her savior, nurtured by the spirit. However, Jesus, revealing himself to Mary, denotes a deeper meaning about women and their place in the spiritual landscape. </p>

        <p>I grew up being told, directly and indirectly, that women aren’t important in our walk with Christ. Our existence revolves around fulfilling the assignment of men and them alone. Our systems revolve around the ideology and philosophy of men. We have turned women into background noise for ourselves and for those around us so it would not be a stretch to infer that a woman doesn’t play any significant role in the walk. We have allowed Adamic beliefs to penetrate the church, and have propagated these policies wrapped up in fear of exclusionary consequences. It doesn’t take a genius to render a woman’s relevance in the space of society and religion. One might even argue that some of those beliefs are rooted in the idea that women were created second (from the rib of a man) and Jesus never appointed a woman as an apostle. I am not here to argue these claims, nor am I here to defend my existence to an audience of nothingness. I’m not precisely sure what I am here to do. Perhaps I am here to tell you the truth. </p>

        <p>The claim that women do not exist or play a pivotal role in the proclamation of the gospel is a hoax. Some documentations and arguments have been able to reveal the truth but it is almost always wrapped up in the context that is inside the existence of man and marriage: “Women are relevant because they produce children for the family to continue a man’s lineage”, “women are relevant because they are here to support a man who is on a divine assignment”. They are never the ones on divine assignment. Even the story of Esther is taught with an underlying theme of a woman who was at the mercy of a man. Our very existence is solely contingent on that of a man. You cannot see a woman without looking at a man. This idea wouldn’t be too problematic if they weren’t singular.  If the same secular beliefs applied to men then my entire truth-telling would have been irrelevant and frankly idiotic. But here we are. </p>

        <p>I always wondered why God chose a woman to bring His Son through a woman. I mean, He is God. There are many other ways that He could have done this. I can list three at the top of my head and I’m only a human with limited knowledge and imagination. Imagine how a transcendent being void of deception and powerlessness would bring and announce Jesus to the world; the results would be infinite. It is hard to concatenate and comprehend, yet He used women to introduce Jesus into the world and to announce His resurrection. Do you know the degree of significance and responsibility that entails? I can’t imagine God giving responsibility for this grandiosity to both women if they weren’t able to handle it but they did and they did both well. Their assignment, just like any other God-given assignment, started with a posture of belief followed by absolute obedience without any room for doubt. Mary believed Gabriel when he said that she was the appointed vessel to bring the messiah to the world. Mary Magdalene believed Jesus when He said that He would rise again on the third day. Why would Jesus send women to announce the entrance of the King? The answer is simple. God is wise and women are life-bringers. </p>

        <p>Mary without a lot of debate gracefully accepted the assignment to bring Jesus (the everlasting life) to the world. Mary Magdalene brought life into the world by announcing the resurrection of Jesus. Both were able to use their intrinsic abilities to perform higher-order assignments. Women are made beautifully to bring life into situations, things, places, and problems. Contrary to popular belief, the whole concept of family would not exist without women. The nature of humanity’s very existence and continuation revolves around women. We are life bringers, literally and figuratively. </p>

        <p>Life goes beyond just birth. This is a rhetoric that has been misconstrued for eons by men of very little understanding. Life is more than just a physical manifestation of an entity. Life is the ability to generate things from what was, what is, and what has never been. Life is spirit and spirit brings life. When there is life there is spirit and every living human has a spirit, that spirit itself brings life to things. In <span>Genesis 2</span>, God made man from dust and breathed life into him. Without the breath from God which is the spirit FROM God (not of God, that would mean another thing entirely), man (short for hu-man) is no different from a chicken or a rat. The Bible didn’t say that God breathed life into a chicken, a goat, or a chimpanzee. He breathed life into the dust, and it became man. Breathing life is God giving man a spirit, the essence of his being. Man noticed that despite his capabilities, he is still insufficient in some ways. He needed a helper. In <span>Genesis 2:20</span>, it says that Adam looked at all the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, and none was found “a comparable helper to him”.</p>

        <p>Two things here. <em>One:</em> Adam understood his place in the hierarchy of creation and his relationship with the created. The bible didn’t say that the duck realized that it needed a helper, or the duck decided/ chose not to help Adam. It said that Adam needed a helper. Adam looked around, reasoned within himself, named all the other creatures, and decided that he needed a helper. The gift of reason and choice was ingrained in man since the very beginning. That is what God’s breath gives, a spirit, which produces choice and reason. Every human is made with this ability, the innate ability to make choices and reason like an image bearer, regardless of whether you believe or not. Our very reality exists because of these two things. God gave us those two things as a gift, but with misuse and lack of understanding, they became a curse. The downfall of many civilizations is because of these two things. The Devil tried and still tries to convince humans that because of these two things, we are not only like the creator but we are Him. How did he do that? He deceived the one who was made to be the life bearer to bring death as a gift instead of life. He deceived Eve.</p>
        
        <p>Two: Adam realized that he needed help. We have already established that Adam can reason. But reasoning does not always result in acceptance or repentance. Job, after affliction, reasoned, but did he accept that he probably needed help and mercy from God before God’s visitation? King Nebuchadnezzar reasoned, King Belshazzar, and a lot more people reasoned, but they didn’t accept that they needed God to intervene and help. In Adam’s case, by providing him with a helper. God caused Adam to sleep and took a rib, the very bone that protects the organ that sustains his very breath. God is very intentional. I wonder, why a bone? Why a rib? He could have taken the femur, the strongest bone in the body, but he took a rib, the bone that protects the organs that are direct representations of life: the heart and lungs. Women were not just made from life to protect life and produce life.  Women were made from the time of the initial creation to bring forth life. Our physical and spiritual attributes support this.</p>

        <p>Considering multiple possibilities is a great way of measuring and understanding the significance of a situation. Because we are created beings, we live in the constraints of time. At a given second, the number of possibilities of things that can occur is dependent on the variables present. Simple probability. For example, when you drive on a one-way street with a driving limit of 25mph, what are the chances that you might have an accident compared to driving on a highway? Higher or lower? The chances for a human, a created being made within certain limitations like time, would be lower. Now, let's go back to the Garden of Eden after the fall of man. God instructed them not to eat the fruit of good and evil, and if they did, they would die. After they ate the fruit, what would you have expected to happen to them as a third-party spectator? Death. In the shoes of Adam and Eve? Also, Death. Yet, with an infinite amount of possibilities that God is capable of creating because He is the creator of time and, therefore, can step out of time, He chose mercy. I hope I haven't lost you. Let's break this down.</p>

        <p>God, omnipotent, omniscient, and transcendent, is more than capable of not just creating but enforcing certain possibilities of realities with very minimal effort, most likely in words, like in the creation of the Earth. Let’s engage our imagination for a second and think of this as a sci-fi movie. He could turn back time and send an angel to remind them of His instructions. He could return man back into dust and create a new one. Because He is God, the possibilities are endless and aren’t at the mercy of any variable. Why is this important? This is to show that whatever decision He makes and the path He chooses holds a great deal of significance. Greater than you and I can imagine. Going back to the Garden, anything could have happened to them, but God showed humanity mercy. He knew that they would eat the fruit, yet He left the tree in the garden because He loves enough to give us the gift of choice, and what benefit would a gift like that be when all decisions are made for you? They ate the fruit, and instead of removing Eve’s womb and banishing both to the wilderness to perish, discontinuing the line of humanity, He showed us mercy with Eve’s womb. The womb is God’s mercy to us. From a woman’s womb, our savior was born. God could have dropped Jesus from heaven, yet He chose to bring Him through a woman’s womb. The womb is God’s mercy to humanity. The family is the product of that mercy and grace.</p>

        <p>We cannot understand our responsibility if we fail to comprehend that both genders come with very unique levels of authority. The authority that a man has is different from that of a woman (I mean, they weren’t created the same way). The misconception and disconnect in this philosophy have led to a mix-match of responsibilities in society; the roles we play on a macro and micro level. This has led to the downfall of so many systems, down to the individual level. Society has made us believe that man’s identity can be formed from the alienation of the cerebral consciousness of humanity. In other words, you will not understand who you are as an individual if you fail to digest the intricate principles behind our collective identity. Before we are Joshua and Esther, we are men and women, and before we are men and women, we are humans. A created being. Your identity is never separate from your creator, and just like any created being, your creator informs you of who you are.</p>

        <p>For centuries, men have imposed their ideology of women's identity and created a whole system to nurture those beliefs. Why? because they fail to understand who they are. They do not understand who they are as men or the role they play in this intricate web of creation. In recent years, women have adopted the same ideology without rigid scrutiny. We sometimes fail to accept that our gender identity as women is independent of men. You are not given the responsibility of a woman because a man rejected the order to be life bearers. God created man and woman independently of one another, but had both in mind when creating. One isn’t superior to the other, looking at it from God’s perspective before the fall of man. We exist as independent entities to fulfill a collective responsibility. Our goal as humans is to revert our understanding to the original design of humankind, before Adamic beliefs, in order to help one another fulfill God’s promises here on earth. </p>

        <p>A good example would be to look at the story of Mary and Joseph. Both had an important role to play in the introduction of Jesus, the way, the truth, and the life into the world. Different, but crucial that they both had an encounter with an angel. The story of Mary and Joseph and so many other icons in the bible is a testament to God’s omnipotence as a creator. Once we understand our true identity by going back to God for the original design, we will see that our existence always points to our creator.</p>

        <p class="prayer">Prayer: Help us to understand and actualize our God-given identity. Help us to live in the fullness of who you have called us to be. You are the Spirit of life. Breathe life into every dry bone in our lives. <cite>- In Jesus name, Amen.</cite></p>
